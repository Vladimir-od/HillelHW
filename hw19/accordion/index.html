                Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
                documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted
                by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
                languages such as JavaScript.

                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
                describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
                such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
                alongside HTML and JavaScript.

                JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
                conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level,
                often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket
                syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
                first-class functions.
